In game:
    Hold shift to upgrade tower with left click. Should be possible both for sellable, and non sellable block tower. 
        Need to think a bit how about the non-sellable case

General:
    Challenge mode?
        Option available after completed game.
        Display two mazes side by side.


Give the option to select which player to view (during running phase).
    Various issues with how this works.
    Need to handle the case where the player to spectate is already finished (right now returns - should show runner at last position)
    Figure out how to clean up animations/sounds if needed.
    Runner "jumps" once after switch.
    Will show the last round for other players sometimes (if not the first round?)

Server:
    Improve handling of:
        Players leaving
        Players not sending results in time
            Have all users ack that simulation has ended? Only then send round end event. Max time ofc.

ScoreBoard:
    Updates result as soon as building phase has ended.
    Sometimes only shows the latest round.


Slight delay before sounds are played.
