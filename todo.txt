In game:
    Hold shift to upgrade tower with left click. Should be possible both for sellable, and non sellable block tower. 
        Need to think a bit how about the non-sellable case
    Runner spins in a werid way when turning west -> north.

General:
    Challenge mode?
        Option available after completed game.
        Display two mazes side by side.


Give the option to select which player to view (during running phase).
    Need to handle the case where the player to spectate is already finished (right now returns - should show runner at last position)
    Figure out how to clean up animations/sounds if needed.
    Choppy animation when viewing another player.
    Will show the last round for other players sometimes (if not the first round?)
