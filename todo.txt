In game:
    Hold shift to upgrade tower with left click. Should be possible both for sellable, and non sellable block tower. 
        Need to think a bit how about the non-sellable case

General:
    Challenge mode?
        Option available after completed game.
        Display two mazes side by side.


Give the option to select which player to view (during running phase).
    Figure out how to clean up animations/sounds as needed.
    Running in 'prod' always get stuck. Round 2 never starts - regardless of view.
  
Server:
    Improve handling of:
        Players leaving
        Players not sending results in time
            Have all users ack that simulation has ended? Only then send round end event. Max time ofc.

Slight delay before sounds are played.
