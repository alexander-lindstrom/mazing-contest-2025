In game:
    Hold shift to upgrade tower with left click. Should be possible both for sellable, and non sellable block tower. 
        Need to think a bit how about the non-sellable case

General:
    Challenge mode?
        Option available after completed game.
        Display two mazes side by side.
  
Server:
    Improve handling of:
        Players leaving
        Players not sending results in time
            Have all users ack that simulation has ended? Only then send round end event. Max time ofc.
