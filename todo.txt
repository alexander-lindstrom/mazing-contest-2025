In game:
    Hold shift to upgrade tower with left click. Should be possible both for sellable, and non sellable block tower. 
        Need to think a bit how about the non-sellable case

General:
    Challenge mode?
        Option available after completed game.
        Display two mazes side by side.


Give the option to select which player to view (during running phase).
    Need the timer to be independent for each player in some way. Without causing issues.
    If two many switches the next round never starts.
    Figure out how to clean up animations/sounds as needed.
  
Server:
    Improve handling of:
        Players leaving
        Players not sending results in time
            Have all users ack that simulation has ended? Only then send round end event. Max time ofc.

Slight delay before sounds are played.
Round result show cumulative time?
